# Changelog
Last Update: December 18, 2019
* All versions of CFC has been merged with v4.0.
* Left 4 Dead 2 version of CFC has been merged with Original CFC. Now you don't need to put 'For Left 4 Dead 2' batch file!
* Added Lite version for people who wants optimized version. Lite Version does not include colors, and more faster than the original.
* Added README.txt file.
* Added Half-Life 2: MMod Support.
* Removed version name on batch and zip file since I'm lazy to provide these on every update for myself.
